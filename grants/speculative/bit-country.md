### Overview
  * A brief description of the project.

      In Bit.Country, you can create your own space, communities, economics, and digital assets (NFTs). The dapp offers both a classical web view and a 3D in-browser view of the country. The decentralized marketplace allows users to trade their digital assets with each other.      

    Countries

        Create your own country and community. Attract more people to join using the rules and policies you can set by your will.
        Grow your country and monetize your community in multiple ways without any intermediaries.

    Blocks

        Content will belong to one of the blocks that make up the whole country. Each block has a topic the content within should adhere to. Each block can also be visualized in a 3D voxel view, in the 3D world, you can create assets on the sections you own.

    Economy

        Create currency for your country, and incentivize the people who contribute to your community.

        As your community grows, your currency will gain value on the exchange. Everyone in the community will benefit from this. Countries can be auctioned, rewarding all who had a stake in it.

    Residents

        Explore countries created by other people. Become a resident and join the community. Countries can set their residential policies.

        Some welcome everyone and even reward you for joining, while others may need you to apply for residency.

    Ownership & Governance

        Residents can earn the country tokens to take ownership and perform their governing rights by voting.

    Marketplace

        Trade your NFTs with residents within the same block, bit country, or entire network.

        We are building the decentralized marketplace into the Substrate module. The auctions and deliveries of items will be completely decentralized and governed by the blockchain network.



  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

    We will build Bit.Country Chain with Substrate technologies. 
    
    Our system will utilise existing pallets as well as develop new pallets for Bit.Country Chain specific requirements such as token economy, marketplace logic, NFT management, staking and governance.

  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

    Our founder, Ray Lu, had a vision of building a decentralized world in 2018. The premium domain name Bit.Country has been registered since then. 
    
    After learning Polkadot and Substrate technologies, we are very excited to finally find the right infrastructure and technology to develop this ambitious vision.

### Project Details 

* Mockups/designs of any UI components

  Please visit https://bit.country

* An overview of the technology stack to be used

  Blockchain - Substrate, Rust  
  Frontend - ReactJs  
  Backend - .NET Core, C# & Mongol DB.

### Ecosystem Fit 

  Bit.Country concept is uniquely invented and inspired by the decentralisation paradigm. It will fit in well for growing and scaling the Polkadot/Substrate community.

  With our incubated EduTech business Industry Connect, and the prospected outcome of the project, naturally, it will bring more blockchain enthusiasts to Polkadot/Substrate community worldwide. 

  Combined with our community being introduced to Polkadot/Substrate through their education and internship experience, we will be enabling new developers interested in blockchain to get a head start on Polkadot and Substrate.
